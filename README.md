For my Sass architecture, I'm using The 7-1 Pattern by Hugo Giraudel.
https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Technologies used:

React, Sass, AWS Amplify, Font Awesome

VSCode Pertinant User Settings:
{
"prettier.printWidth": 100,
"prettier.trailingComma": "es5"
}

Roadmap/Ideas:
